The BJCP was visualized by David Fischer; he plotted IBU (bitterness) across the bottom but alcohol content on the Y axis. A more logical version (IMHO) would have been to put the SRM on the Y axis.


* International bittering units or IBU is a way of measuring the perceived bitterness of beer

* Standard Reference Method or SRM is a system for measuring the color of beer

#### Summary table

```{r}

styles <- read_csv("styles.csv")

styles %>%
  filter(`SRM Mid` > 20 & `IBU Mid` < 50) %>%
  arrange(`IBU Mid`) %>%
  select(Number, `Style Name`, `Style Category`, `IBU Mid`, `SRM Mid`)


```


```{r}

ggplot(styles, aes(x=`IBU Mid`, y=`SRM Mid`)) +
  geom_point()

```
